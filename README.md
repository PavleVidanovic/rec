To Whom It May Concern,

I had the pleasure of mentoring Pavle Vidanovic during his tenure as a Junior Data Scientist at Prime Holding JSC, where he made significant contributions to several projects.
Pavle began his journey with our company in September 2022 when he stood out and was selected from a pool of 111 candidates for our internship program. After successfully completing the program, he was one of only three candidates to be chosen for a full-time contract.
During his tenure with us, Pavle consistently demonstrated a deep understanding of software engineering and data science. One of his standout contributions was to the project focused on retrieval-augmented generation for information retrieval and processing using vector databases. For this project, Pavle expertly designed and developed comprehensive backend and middleware services, leveraging both Python and Node.js. Additionally, he skillfully crafted a complete API service and adeptly integrated an advanced front-end using React and TypeScript. This not only showcased his technical expertise but also his ability to translate business requirements into actionable technical tasks.
Pavle has proven to be a quick learner, adapting to new tools and programming languages with ease. He demonstrated proficiency in Python and SQL and ability to research complex and advanced topics with minimum supervision. Beyond his technical prowess, Pavle exhibited a strong team-oriented mindset. He collaborated effectively with our data engineers, business analysts, and other stakeholders, ensuring that all technical deliverables were aligned with our business objectives.
Pavle would be an invaluable asset to any team or organization. His blend of technical acumen, problem-solving skills, and team spirit is truly commendable. I am confident that he will continue to excel and drive impactful data-driven products wherever he goes.
